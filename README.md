Setup
=====

Step 1 : Install Bower
----------------------
This project depends on the Polymer project and does not include it's sources.  See http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/getting-the-code.html.  It is strongly recommended to use Bower for managing the Polymer dependencies.  Although Bower is a little laborsome to get up and going it'll save you in the long run...

Step 2 : Install dependencies
-----------------------------
cd \<this project root\>

bower install

Sit back and relax while it gets all the dependencies!
